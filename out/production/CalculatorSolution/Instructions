Steps:
	
	1. Complete the Range class assignments
	2. Complete RandomNumber assignments
	3. Go over Question abstract class and understand it is methods and variables. (You don't need to do anything in there)
	4. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division classes inherits Question class
		a. In each above mentioned class inherit Question abstract class
		b. Create a constructor in each class that accepts an object of Range type:
		    (In constructor do below steps.)
			1. Call super constructor and pass values to questionType, operator (questionType value can be any)
			2. Using RandomNumber class static methods generate two numbers within the min and max range of
			Range object and assign generated values to operand1, operand2 instance variables.
			3. In Subtraction and Division classes the operand1 shouldn't be smaller than operand2
			(make sure operand1 is always greater than operand2.)
		c. Override calc method:
			1. set calculated variable to true
			2. set result of calculation to answer instance variable
		d. Override toString method:
			1. if result is not calculated it will return in format: 24+44=
			2. if result is calculated it will return in format: 10+5=15
	5. Run CalculatorTest class
	6. Run Tests class
